# MNIST-DIGITS-KMEANS-Clustering
This is a notebook where I used KMEANS on the mnist digits dataset imported from sklearn. And I also applied t-SNE (Stochastic Neighbors Embedding) to reduce the dimensions of the dataset in order to graph the resullting clusters in a 2D scatter plot using matplotlib and plotly. 


And if you want to see the ploty graphs please this link below:
